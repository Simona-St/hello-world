And when you feel that heat, the world is at your feet
No one can hold you down if you really want it
Just steal your destiny, rght from the hands of fate
Reach for the cup of life 'cause your name is on it
Do you really want it (Yeah!)
Do you really want it (Yeah!)
Here we go! Ale, ale, ale!
Go, go, go! Ale, ale, ale!
Tonight's the night we're gonna celebrate
The cup of life! Ale, ale, ale!
